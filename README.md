# EdX_Machine_Learning

As a group leader, I led a group project of CSE416 at University of Washington focused on EdX student model training and evaluation. In this role, I applied various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, and Neural Networks, to predict course completion using anonymized student data. Our team achieved an outstanding 98.2% prediction accuracy in a Kaggle competition, securing the top position among 81 participating teams.
